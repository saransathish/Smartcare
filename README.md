# Improvising User Interactive Ai healthcare Bot Using BERT (Project in Progress)
 
### Project Overview
This project aims to create an **AI-Driven Patient Assistant** using **BERD** to enhance patient care and engagement. The system continuously learns from patient feedback and healthcare interactions to provide adaptive and optimized healthcare recommendations. By integrating **Augmented Reality (AR)**, we aim to create an intuitive and interactive healthcare experience.

### Key Features
- **Personalized Patient Care:** The assistant adapts healthcare suggestions in real-time based on individual patient data and interactions.
- **BERT Learning Model:** The RL core learns from patient behavior to improve healthcare outcomes over time.
- **Real-time Monitoring and Decision Support:** Sensors and AI analytics continuously monitor the patientâ€™s health and provide timely insights.
- **Augmented Reality Integration:** AR-based visualizations help patients easily understand health data and follow healthcare instructions.
- **Adaptive and Scalable System:** Designed to be accessible to users in both hospital and home care settings, and adaptable to various healthcare environments.

### Objectives
1. **Develop a Personalized AI Patient Assistant:** Use RL to create a dynamic system capable of learning from patient interactions.
2. **Enhance Patient Engagement and Compliance:** Provide reminders and feedback to encourage adherence to treatment plans.
3. **Implement Real-time Monitoring:** Use IoT devices and sensors to track patient vitals and offer decision support for clinicians.
4. **Ensure Compliance with Regulations:** Follow healthcare regulations (HIPAA, GDPR) and implement safety protocols.

### System Architecture
- **Reinforcement Learning AI Core**: Personalized healthcare suggestions based on continuous learning from patient feedback.
- **AR Interface**: Integrated with smartphones and wearables for easy interaction with healthcare data.
- **Data Collection & Integration**: Real-time monitoring using Electronic Health Records (EHR), wearables, and IoT devices.
